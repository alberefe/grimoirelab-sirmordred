## sirmordred 0.8.0 - (2023-05-17)

**New features:**

 * Optional configuration for SortingHat\
   Include an optional configuration for SortingHat to define the name of
   the tenant when multi-tenancy is enabled.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Race condition initializing SirMordred\
   There was a race condition when SirMordred initializes. The thread
   that read the list of projects didn't have time to even start before
   the manager finalizes it, so data backends didn't have any have any
   input to work with. This bug was originally reported by ncsibra-lab49
   on
   [grimoirelab#585](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/585).
