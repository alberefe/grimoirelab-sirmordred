  Fix issue where some fields were not refreshed.
  The bug occurred because the queries to OpenSearch filtered
  items in which `author_uuid` was the individual pk, but not
  when the `<role>_uuid` was the individual pk. That causes many
  items that contain the `<role>_uuid` but not the `author_uuid`
  not to be refreshed.
