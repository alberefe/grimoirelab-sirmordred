title: Race condition initializing SirMordred

notes: >
  There was a race condition when SirMordred initializes.
  The thread that read the list of projects didn't have
  time to even start before the manager finalizes it,
  so data backends didn't have any have any input to work
  with. This bug was originally reported by ncsibra-lab49 on
  [grimoirelab#585](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/585).
