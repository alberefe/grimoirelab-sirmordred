title: Reduced the number of connections to SortingHat
category: performance
author: Quan Zhou
issue: null
notes: >
    Mordred makes a lot of connections to the SortingHat server
    which could cause the uWSGI queue to fill up. When the uWSGI
    queue is full, Mordred cannot connect to the SortingHat server.
