**Bug fixes:**

 * Identity refresh bug for some items\
   Fix issue where some fields were not refreshed. The bug occurred
   because the queries to OpenSearch filtered items in which
   `author_uuid` was the individual pk, but not when the `<role>_uuid`
   was the individual pk. That causes many items that contain the
   `<role>_uuid` but not the `author_uuid` not to be refreshed.
