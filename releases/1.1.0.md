## sirmordred 1.1.0 - (2024-08-30)

**Performance improvements:**

 * Reduced the number of connections to SortingHat\
   Mordred makes a lot of connections to the SortingHat server which
   could cause the uWSGI queue to fill up. When the uWSGI queue is full,
   Mordred cannot connect to the SortingHat server.
