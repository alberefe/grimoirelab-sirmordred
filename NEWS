     - cereslib >= 0.3
     - kidash >= 0.5
     - grimoirelab-penales >= 0.1
     - grimoire-elk >= 0.102

   Perceval dependencies are removed because they are installed
   with `grimoire-elk`.

   Add the `pair-programming` to the `_get_enrich_backend` method if it
   exists in the setup.cfg file.

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.6 support\
   Python 3.6 reached the end of life at the end of 2021. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   Therefore, this package will only work with Python >= 3.7 from now on.
 * FINOS Meeting backend removed\
   FINOS Meeting backend is not supported anymore. The Perceval backend
   was archived in Bitergia repository so it shouldn't be part of the
   core anymore because it's software not maintained.

**Others:**

 * Add studies to the alias file\
   Add onion, areas of code, and demographics studies to the file
   aliases.json. This is needed to keep this file updated with the
   aliases we use in the dashboards by adding them to the appropiate data
   sources. The included aliases: - all_onion - git_areas_of_code -
   demographics
